<p>
	Thanks for visiting us online. If you have a moment, we'd like to tell you a bit about Tool Time.
</p>
<p>
	We are your local hardware store and we are a part of your community. Our stores are employee owned 
	operated by local entrepreneurs. These hard working men and women are part of the fabric of your community. 
	They are small business owners who are local and loyal. While others have become large and impersonal, 
	at Tool Time, we've remained small and very personal. That's why going to Tool Time is like a visit to your neighbor.
</p>
<p>
	Founded in 1990 by a small group of Oregon hardware store owners, Tool Time changed the retail landscape by allowing 
	individual stores to purchase merchandise in bulk to save money and buy at the lowest possible price. This partnership 
	enabled even the smaller stores to compete effectively at retail despite larger stores in their market. 
</p>
<p>
	Thanks for visiting us. For a far more personal form of service, be sure to visit us at your local store.

<p>
	At Tool Time, we pride ourselves on being the helpful place. We believe in giving back to the communities we do business 
	in and helping those in need. Since 1991, Ace has been a proud partner of the American Red Cross. Through our stores, 
	collaborating with vendor partners and employee giving, we have raised over $100 million for the American Red Cross through 
	product donation when a disaster strikes.
</p>
<p>
	We also offer grant awards up to $5,000 to 501(c) designated organizations (recognized and in good standing with the IRS for a 
	minimum of one year) and tax-exempt public service agencies in the U.S. that are using the power of volunteers to improve the 
	community. Grants are given in the form of Tool Time gift cards for the purchase of tools, materials, or services and are 
	required to be complete within six months of approval date.
